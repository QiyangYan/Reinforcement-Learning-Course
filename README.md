# Reinforcement-Learning-Intro

This repository serves as a comprehensive record of my self-learning journey in learning and implementing various reinforcement learning algorithms. It documents the resources I utilised and the algorithms I have implemented. Please note that this repository is a work in progress, and I will continue to update it as I progress further in my reinforcement learning journey. Feel free to explore the code and resources here, and I welcome any feedback or suggestions!

### Learning Resources

Throughout this course, I have relied on the following learning resources:

1. **Intro to Reinforcement Learning - Bolei Zhou**: This resource provided a solid introduction to the fundamental concepts and principles of reinforcement learning.
2. **Deep Learning Course - MatchLab-Imperial**: This course offered valuable insights into deep learning techniques, which are often employed in reinforcement learning.
3. **Reinforcement Learning Course Note**: The file within this repository titled "Reinforcement Learning Course Note" contains additional links and notes that further enriched my understanding of reinforcement learning.

### Implemented Algorithms

As part of my learning process, I have also included the reinforcement learning algorithms I implemented under the folder: RL Practical
